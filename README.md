🌌 About the Game

Rail of the Dead is a fast-paced first-person endless survival game set on the rooftops of a runaway train. You’re always running forward, the train never ends, and the zombies never stop coming.

Your mission is simple: survive for as long as possible. The further you go, the faster the train runs and the stronger the undead become. It’s all about reflexes, weapon switching, and raw survival instinct.

🕹️ Gameplay Loop

🚂 Run forward — the train forces you into constant movement
🧟 Fight zombies — they spawn ahead and rush at you
🔫 Loot weapons — shotguns, RPGs, melee scattered on cars
⏳ Survive longer — speed and difficulty scale over time
💀 Die eventually — the horde always wins, but how far can you go?

🎭 The Three Pillars

The Player – Always moving forward, sprinting, jumping, dodging, and fighting with whatever weapons they can find
The Train – Procedurally generated infinite cars that speed up over time, with randomized loot and obstacles
The Zombies – Endless horde of walkers, runners, and tanks, growing faster and stronger the longer you survive

🎨 Visual & Atmosphere

The game uses a low-poly graphic style, keeping it clean, optimized, and indie-stylish. The atmosphere is dark, cinematic, and moody, with rain, sparks, fog, and broken train cars adding tension. Think Mirror’s Edge movement mixed with Left 4 Dead chaos, all wrapped in a low poly apocalypse aesthetic.
